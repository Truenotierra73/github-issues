Incidentally besides that jumping out, I noticed this because I couldn't get the same error in that repo, like the Stackblitz was throwing. After messing around, I provided the router to the Stackblitz and it stopped throwing. And when I go back and forth between adding and removing that in either application, `provideRouter(routes)]` seems to stop the error.\n\n### Please provide the expected behavior vs the actual behavior you encountered [Bug Report only]\n\nNo error thrown\n\n### Please provide a screenshot if possible [Bug Report only]\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd8461b5-8bf5-41f1-bebe-48e6dc9dcc1e)\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw [Bug Report only]\n\n```true\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'index')\n    at ds (client-event-subscribers.ts:286:33)\n    at ms (client-event-subscribers.ts:302:26)\n    at fs (client-event-subscribers.ts:228:19)\n    at client-event-subscribers.ts:167:69\n    at n (same-page-message-bus.ts:46:21)\n```\n\n### Is this a browser-specific issue?

    "body": "Makes the following changes to the compiler to accommodate some future changes:\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler): allow binder to apply to more than one set of nodes \r\nCurrently `R3TargetBinder.bind` gets a set of data back from `DirectiveBinder.apply` and `TemplateBinder.applyWithScope`. This will be annoying  if we have multiple sources of data, because we'd have to do merge them at the end.\r\n\r\nThese changes switch to constructing the various data structures ahead of time and passing them into the binders to populate them instead.\r\n\r\nI also extracted some of the less trivial types into type aliases so we don't have to repeat them.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): allow node offsets to be overwritten \r\n\r\nIn some cases the offsets produced by `createSourceSpan` might not match the source node exactly (e.g. string literals) so we need to be able to override them.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): change TemplateId terminology \r\n\r\nRenames the `TemplateId` and terminology related to it, because we'll be using it for more than just templates.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): rework type checking internals to accommodate more than components\r\n\r\nCurrently a lot of the internal type checking data structures are set up specifically for components, because we only support type checking of templates. Since this will change in future commits, these changes prepare for it by renaming various methods and separating out component-specific data.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): rework source manager to accommodate directives \r\n\r\nCurrently the `TemplateSourceManager` is set up to specifically cater to component templates. These changes make it more generic so we can reuse it for directives.\r\n\r\n### refactor(compiler-cli): rework resource handling to allow directives \r\n\r\nCurrently only components can have resources, because they're the only symbol kinds being type checked. Since we want to add directives to it, these changes rework the resource handling to accommodate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n### refactor(language-service): rename internal symbols to accommodate type checking outside a template\r\n\r\nCurrently the language service has some template-specific terminology around type checking, because that's the only place where we had TCB support. These changes make it more generic to accommodate future functionality.",

Nontheless I have to say, I did not managed to get it anymore detailed as I wrote above in one day of digging.\n\nI would be thankful for any help to get this working with the new angular version :)\n\nThanks in advance\n\nStefan\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\n\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular 19.2.0\nNX latest version 20.4.6\n\nError occured during unit-test execution\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "When signal inputs were introduced, we chose to treat them identically to property inputs for purposes of input setting logic (ngOnChanges, marking for check, ng-reflect, etc). This made sense to ensure switching from `@Input` to `input()` was as seamless and non-breaking as possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, a consequence of this choice is that a property binding to an input signal causes the receiving component to be marked for check even if the input signal is _not_ used in the template directly. For example, it could be used in a `computed` which might not actually change, or it may only be used to drive an `effect`. In those cases, it's unnecessary to check the template at all.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces logic to treat input signals differently in the binding path, and avoid marking components for check _purely_ when the input changes. If the input signal is used in the template (either directly or indirectly) the signal change notification will cause the template to be checked via the fast path for signals.\r\n",

Let me know if I could share something more specific.\n\nThe project I'm working on is 6 years old and I don't discard there might be some misconfiguration being used from older Angular versions.

    "body": "### Which @angular/* package(s) are relevant/related to the feature request?\n\ncore\n\n### Description\n\nI have a `ControlValueAccessor` implementation to handle file inputs. It is fairly straightforward.\n\n```typescript\nexport class Example implements ControlValueAccessor {\n  @HostListener('change', ['$event.target.files ?? null']) public executeOnChangeHandler(value: null | FileList): void {\n    this.#onChangeHandler?.(value);\n  }\n\n  public writeValue(value: null): void {\n    this.#renderer.setProperty(this.#elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', value);\n  }\n\n  // ... the rest of the implementation\n}\n```\n\nIn case the file input gets interacted with before hydration the `'change'` events will be captured by event replay. But my `'change'` event listener reads the most recent `files` property on the input element which got meanwhile reset by `writeValue()` by the time the captured event gets replayed.\n\nAs a result event replay is not working as expected and the form field basically gets reset during hydration as described in #53917.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nSince Angular already supports selecting function arguments with an expression I would like to propose using that expression to cache the function arguments when capturing an event.\n\nIn case of my example the flow would be like this:\n\n- The prerendered page loads with a pristine file input.\n- The user selects a file.\n- Event replay captures the `'change'` event **and evaluates the function argument selector `('$event.target.files ?? null')`**. It will cache the result.\n- The component taking care of the file input hydrates. It calls `writeValue()` with the initial value.\n- Event replay invokes the `'change'` event handler with the previously cached arguments.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nFor now I'm using an internal boolean flag to avoid setting the initial value.\n\n```typescript\nexport class Example implements ControlValueAccessor {\n  #wroteFirstValue = false;\n\n  @HostListener('change', ['$event.target.files ?? null']) public executeOnChangeHandler(value: null | FileList): void {\n    this.#onChangeHandler?.(value);\n  }\n\n  public writeValue(value: null): void {\n    if (this.#wroteFirstValue) {\n      this.#renderer.setProperty(this.#elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', value);\n    } else {\n      this.#wroteFirstValue = true;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // ... the rest of the implementation\n}\n```\n\nBut this only works because the `ControlValueAccessor` implementation knows it deals with a prerendered file input and the initial value is actually the native default value. I would prefer to have a `ControlValueAccessor` implementation which doesn't need to know anything about the outside conditions.",

    "body": "### Which @angular/* package(s) are the source of the bug?\n\ncore\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Description\n\nAccording to this documentation (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/page-lifecycle-api?hl=de) I've created a Angular service telling me the current AppState.\n\nNow that I've reworked it to use a Signal (instead of an RxJs BehaviorSubject) I've got an `NG0600: Writing to signals is not allowed in a `computed`` error.\n\nI could have broken it down to the following min repro:\n\n```\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  standalone: true,\n  template: `\n<form [formGroup]=\"signInForm\">\n\n<button [disabled]=\"signInForm.disabled\"\n        (click)=\"signIn()\">\n        HIT ME\n</button>\n\n</form>\n  `,\n  imports: [FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule],\n})\nexport class App {\n  signInForm = inject(FormBuilder).group({});\n\n  constructor() {\n    fromEvent(window, 'blur', { capture: true })\n      .pipe(tap((_) => console.warn('executed')))\n      .subscribe((_) => this.testSignal.set(this.testSignal()));\n  }\n\n  testSignal = signal(true);\n\n  signIn(): void {\n    this.signInForm.disable();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe problem is: it works in most of the cases! I see several `executed` in the console but (probably) combined with some router navigation it fails. If it is interessting I could try to isolate the actual issue? But it seams pretty hard ... Maybe someone has an idea already?\n\nImho the code should just work fine, right? Here's the actual code that threw the error:\n\n```\nmerge(\n\t...['pageshow', 'focus', 'blur', 'visibilitychange', 'resume'].map(e => fromEvent(window, e, opts).pipe(tap(_ => console.log(e)), map(_ => getAppState()))),\n\tfromEvent(window, 'freeze', opts).pipe(map(_ => AppState.Frozen)),\n\tfromEvent(window, 'pagehide', opts).pipe(map((e: PageTransitionEvent) => e.persisted ? AppState.Frozen : AppState.Terminated))\n).subscribe(v => this.appState$.set(v));\n```\n\n### Please provide a link to a minimal reproduction of the bug\n\n[Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-autjirhq?file=src%2Fmain.ts)\n\n### Please provide the exception or error you saw\n\n```true\nRuntimeError: NG0600: Writing to signals is not allowed in a `computed`.\n```\n\n### Please provide the environment you discovered this bug in (run `ng version`)\n\n```true\nAngular CLI: 19.1.8\nNode: 22.11.0\nPackage Manager: pnpm 10.4.1\nOS: win32 x64\n\nAngular: 19.1.7\n... animations, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\n... service-worker\n\nPackage                           Version\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n@angular-devkit/architect         0.1901.8 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/build-angular     19.1.8\n@angular-devkit/core              19.1.8 (cli-only)\n@angular-devkit/schematics        19.1.8 (cli-only)\n@angular/cdk                      19.1.5\n@angular/cli                      19.1.8\n@angular/material                 19.1.5\n@angular/material-luxon-adapter   19.1.5\n@schematics/angular               19.1.8 (cli-only)\nrxjs                              7.8.1\ntypescript                        5.7.3\nzone.js                           0.15.0\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",
